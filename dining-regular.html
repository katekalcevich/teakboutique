        <h2>Provence</h2>
        <p>Our trestle-based Provence tables are designed with old world charm. Two table top options are available: either a galvanized steel top that is painted to resemble stone, or our classic teak top with thick wood slats. All teak wood is solid, distressed, and hand-painted in a gray finish for a weathered appearance. Natural features in the wood such as knots, checking and other imperfections are some of the characteristics that give these tables their distressed qualities.<br>
