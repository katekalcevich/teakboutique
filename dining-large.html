        <h2>Essex</h2>
        <p>One of our larger tables, the oval Essex 114" comfortably seats ten to twelve people in the expanded position and six to eight in the closed position. This table has two rotating and self-storing leaves that transform the large 114" table into a smaller 80" version. The table accommodates the largest of our umbrellas. It is not necessary to remove the umbrella when changing the table size. Shown here with our Gearhart folding chairs.<br>

        <h2>Provence</h2>
        <p>Our trestle-based Provence tables are designed with old world charm. Two table top options are available: either a galvanized steel top that is painted to resemble stone, or our classic teak top with thick wood slats. All teak wood is solid, distressed, and hand-painted in a gray finish for a weathered appearance. Natural features in the wood such as knots, checking and other imperfections are some of the characteristics that give these tables their distressed qualities.<br>
