        <h2>Adirondack</h2>
        <p>The original Adirondack chair was conceived more than 100 years ago in the mountains of upstate New York. Prized for its simplistic Craftsman style and exceptional comfort, it has become one of the most iconic and popular seating items for the outdoors. Our version of the Adirondack chair is extremely comfortable, with a seat and back that are perfectly angled for relaxing, reading, or conversing with friends. Made from solid teak with brass hardware.<br>
